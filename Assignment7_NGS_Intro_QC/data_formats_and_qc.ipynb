    "# NGS Data formats and QC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are several file formats for storing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. In this tutorial we will look at some of the most common formats for storing NGS reads and variant data. We will cover the following formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "__FASTQ__ - This format stores unaligned read sequences with base qualities  \n",
    "__SAM/BAM__ - This format stores unaligned or aligned reads (text and binary formats)  \n",
    "__CRAM__ - This format is similar to BAM but has better compression than BAM  \n",
    "__VCF/BCF__ - Flexible variant call format for storing SNPs, indels, structural variations (text and binary formats)   \n",
    "\n",
    "Further to understanding the different file formats, it is important to remember that all sequencing platforms have technical limitations that can introduce biases in your sequencing data. Because of this it is very important to check the quality of the data before starting any analysis, whether you are planning to use something you have sequenced yourself or publicly available data. In the second part of this tutorial we will describe how to perform a QC assessment for your NGS data.\n"

    "[SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) format was developed by the 1000 Genomes Project group in 2009 and is a unified format for storing read alignments to a reference genome. SAM format is a standard format for storing NGS sequencing reads, base qualities, associated meta-data and alignments of the data to a reference genome. If no reference genome is available, the data can also be stored unaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files consist of a header section (optional) and an alignment section. The alignment section contains one record (a single DNA fragment alignment) per line describing the alignment between fragment and reference. Each record has 11 fixed columns and optional key:type:value tuples. Open the SAM/BAM file specification document [https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) either in a web browser or you can find a copy in the QC directory as you may need to refer to it throughout this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us have a closer look at the different parts of the SAM/BAM format. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Header Section\n",
    "\n",
    "The header section of a SAM file looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<insert header text>\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in the SAM header begins with an `@`, followed by a two-letter header record type code as defined in the [SAM/BAM format specification document](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf). Each record type can contain meta-data captured as a series of key-value pairs in the format of ‘TAG:VALUE’.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read groups\n",
    "One useful record type is RG which can be used to describe each lane of sequencing. The RG code can be used to capture extra meta-data for the sequencing lane. Some common RG TAGs are:\n",

    "* ID: SRR/ERR number\n",

    "* CN: Sequencing centre\n",

    "A read that aligns to a single reference sequence (including insertions, deletions, skips and clipping but not direction changes), is a __linear alignment__. If a read cannot be represented as a linear alignment, but instead is represented as a group of linear alignments without large overlaps, it is called a __chimeric alignment__. These can for instance be caused by structural variations. Usually, one of the linear alignments in a chimeric alignment is considered to be the __representative__ alignment, and the others are called __supplementary__.\n",

    "Sometimes a read maps equally well to more than one spot. In these cases, one of the possible alignments is marked as the __primary__ alignment and the rest are marked as __secondary__ alignments.\n",

    "## BAM\n",
    "BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) format, is a compressed binary version of SAM. This means that, while SAM is human readable, BAM is only readable for computers. BAM was developed for fast processing and random access. To achieve this, BGZF (Block GZIP) compression is used for indexing. BAM files can be viewed using samtools, and will then have the same format as a SAM file.  The key features of BAM are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can store alignments from most mappers\n",
    "* Supports multiple sequencing technologies\n",
    "* Supports indexing for quick retrieval/viewing\n",
    "* Compact size (e.g. 112Gbp Illumina = 116GB disk space)\n",
    "* Reads can be grouped into logical groups e.g. lanes, libraries, samples\n",
    "* Widely supported by variant calling packages and viewers\n",
    "\n",
    "Since BAM is a binary format, we can't use the standard UNIX operations directly on this file format. __Samtools__ is a set of programs for interacting with SAM and BAM files. Using the samtools view command, print the header of the BAM file:"

    "The VCF file format was introduced to store variation data. VCF consists of tab-delimited text and is parsable by standard UNIX commands which makes it flexible and user-extensible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### VCF header\n",
    "The VCF header consists of meta-information lines (starting with `##`) and a header line (starting with `#`). All meta-information lines are optional and can be put in any order, except for _fileformat_. This holds the information about which version of VCF is used and must come first. \n",
    "\n",
    "The meta-information lines consist of key=value pairs. Examples of meta-information lines that can be included are ##INFO, ##FORMAT and ##reference. The values can consist of multiple fields enclosed by `<>`. More information about these fields is available in the VCF specification [http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf). This can be accessed using a web browser and there is a copy in the QC directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Header line\n",
    "The header line starts with `#` and consists of 8 required fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CHROM: an identifier from the reference genome\n",
    "2. POS: the reference position\n",
    "3. ID: a list of unique identifiers (where available)\n",
    "4. REF: the reference base(s)\n",
    "5. ALT: the alternate base(s)\n",
    "6. QUAL: a phred-scaled quality score\n",
    "7. FILTER: filter status\n",
    "8. INFO: additional information\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file contains genotype data, the required fields are also followed by a FORMAT column header, and then a number of sample IDs. The FORMAT field specifies the data types and order. Some examples of these data types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GT: Genotype, encoded as allele values separated by either / or |\n",
    "* DP: Read depth at this position for this sample\n",
    "* GQ: Conditional genotype quality, encoded as a phred quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Body\n",
    "In the body of the VCF, each row contains information about a position in the genome along with genotype information on samples for each position, all according to the fields in the header line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BCF\n",
    "\n",
    "BCF is a compressed binary representation of VCF.\n",
    "\n",
    "VCF can be compressed with BGZF (bgzip) and  indexed with TBI or CSI (tabix), but even compressed it can still be very big. For example, a compressed VCF with 3781 samples of human data will be 54 GB for chromosome 1, and 680 GB for the whole genome. VCFs can also be slow to parse, as text conversion is slow. The main bottleneck is the \"FORMAT\" fields. For this reason the BCF format was developed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In BCF files the fields are rearranged for fast access. The following images show the process of converting a VCF file into a BCF file. \n",

    "Let's have a look at the header of the file 1kg.bcf in the data directory. Note that bcftools uses __`-h`__ to print only the header, while samtools uses __`-H`__ for this. "

    "[Illumina sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_dye_sequencing) technology relies on sequencing by synthesis. One of the most common problems with this is __dephasing__. For each sequencing cycle, there is a possibility that the replication machinery slips and either incorporates more than one nucleotide or perhaps misses to incorporate one at all. The more cycles that are run (i.e. the longer the read length gets), the greater the accumulation of these types of errors gets. This leads to a heterogeneous population in the cluster, and a decreased signal purity, which in turn reduces the precision of the base calling. The figure below shows an example of this."
